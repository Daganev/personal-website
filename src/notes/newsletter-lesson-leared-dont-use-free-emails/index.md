Always use professional email ex- john@snow.com rather than free email ex john@gmail.com for sending mass emails/newsletters.

Free email providers like Gmail, Yahoo etc will mark your sender email as spam by default. This is the official policy from these email providers. They are meant for personal use.

My delivery rate jumped from 20% to 80% just by making a switch in email sender.
