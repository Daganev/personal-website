*   Responsive HTML5 prototype for P2 Training Portal based on the provided storyboard designs.
*   "P2" is an enterprise-wide integrated workflow orchestration tool that tracks the progress of all construction job types – providing visibility into the status of milestones, accurate cost of each project, the data to build forecasts, and the ability to roll up those metrics to a national view.
*   For this project, we built  a simple website that will be used by internal users to get information on the P2 program.
*   AngularJs was used to build dynamic interactions  into the prototype.
*   Animate On Scroll library is used for animation effects into prototype.
